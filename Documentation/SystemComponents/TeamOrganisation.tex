\subsection{Team Organisation}
\label{ssec:team_organisation}

The group consists of 5 students. Since there were a number of distinct
sections to the project, the different components were distributed among the
members of the team with one person in a position of responsibility for that
component and another to provide assistance. The allocations were as follows.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{@{}rll@{}}
		\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Responsible} & \textbf{Assiting} \\ \midrule
		GUI              & Benjamin Crispin & Deedar Fatima    \\
		Client           & Josh Wainwright  & Rowan Stringer   \\
		Server           & Rowan Stringer   & Benjamin Crispin \\
		Database         & Deedar Fatima    & Sam Farmer       \\
		Protocol         & Sam Farmer       & Josh Wainwright  \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These roles were followed closely during the initial stages of development and
through the first round of testing. As the program became more complete and bug
fixes were required, the roles were shared more evenly through the team. This
has the advantage that all members have a full understanding of all aspects of
the project having worked on all parts at some time.
