\section{Client}
\label{sec:client}

The client exists to accept messages sent by the server, and present them in an
order and a format that the user interface can present to the user, as well as
accept the information entered by the user into the user interface and pass it
to the server.

\subsection{System Design}
\label{sub:client_system_design}

When a client is started, a client object is created and starts the main loop.
The initial stages set up the connection with the server and waits for the
user to login.
