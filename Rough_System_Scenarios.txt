Model

View/GUI

1. Logging In
	a. User types in details to the client GUI
	b. Model sends LogIn() object to the server
	c. Server sends request to database/JDBC
	d. Database/JDBC checks that the username exists, then compares the
	   password, and responds to the server
	e. If the user/password exists, client thread is updated to display the
	   ‘waiting to start quiz’ screen, else an ‘incorrect login details’
	   message is displayed

2. Starting a quiz
	a. Admin sends a request to the server to start a specific quiz
	b. Server sends message to the database, and receives back a Quiz() object
	   containing Question() objects
	c. Server sends the first Question() object to each of the clients
	d. Clients receive Question(), their display is updated to show the
	   Question screen, and a timestamp is taken
	e. User answers the question. The client checks that their answer is
	   correct, and creates a second timestamp. This is compared with the first
	   timestamp to determine their score for the question.
	f. The client sends a (true/false, score) to the server
	g. Server collects the scores for each question and sends a ‘league table’
	   to the clients
